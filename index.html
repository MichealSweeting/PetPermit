           <p class="main-txt"><strong> My service is not a guarantee the permit will be granted. </strong>
               This is solely the decision for the Bahamas Department of Agriculture and I have no influence on that decision.
               However, in my experience the applications are generally granted if the requirements are met and the proper 
               documentation is provided during the application.I help to make sure that is the case so you avoid the unfortunate 
               situation of a denial or the back-and-forth that may happen when the documentation is incorrect.
     <strong>The USDA APHIS form or a “Pet Passport” IS NOT required for entry.</strong>
                USDA’s APHIS website refers visitors back to the Bahamas Department of Agriculture form.
        
           <strong>The Bahamas Pet Import Application has recently changed (July 2017)</strong> and many old versions
                are still available, such as this one from bahamas.com (official tourism website)<strong> Do not use the old permit form, </strong>
                download the correct application from my site.
            Department of Agriculture links of interest: Bringing Pets and Dog permit and their phone number: (242) 397-7450/325-7438  </p>

 <p class="ftr-p">$57 per pet, per application
    $27 each additional entry for the same pet
    You may request more than one visit permit per application. 
    Each additional visit permit (additional entry for the same pet) is $27 due to additional complexity and time required.
    </p>
 <p class="ftr-p"> A different pet will require a separate application and therefor a separate $57 fee, 
     plus any additional entries if desired.
