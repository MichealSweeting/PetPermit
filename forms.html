              <h3>Bahamas Pet Dog/Cat Import Quarantine: </h3>
              <p>
                The Bahamas does not routinely quarantine dogs or cats when being imported. 
                Certain cases may arise where it is necessary, but it is not common practice
                 for dogs which are visually in good health and arrive with the proper import permit. </p>
           <p>Bahamas Pet Import Requirements:
            The requirements have been recently updated. Please see the updated requirements <a href="Howitworks.html"> here.</a> </p>
